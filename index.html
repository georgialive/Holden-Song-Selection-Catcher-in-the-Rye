            <h3 class="song__lyrics">
                Eight years old and he's kicking and screaming <br>
                "I'll only go to school if you give me a reason <br>
                The kids are really mean and I already know <br>
                All the things they're teaching" <br>
                Hopped in the car, mama let him play hooky <br>
                Missed the first hour just to get a cup of coffee <br>
                She's the only one who saw who he was <br>
                No one else could read him <br>
                Showing up late but he makes it to class <br>
                Just to stare out the window and the clock in the back <br>
                He daydreamed away to a sky so gray <br>
                Everything's simple, it's driving him mental <br>
                Wishing everyday that something would change <br>
                Instead his dad makes him play ball by the bay <br>
                And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes, saying <br>
                "Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?" <br>
                He does all that he should <br>
                Why is he misunderstood? <br>
                This is a story 'bout a broken boy<br>
                With his headphones in just to block out the noise<br>
                Of everyone around him telling him the way to go<br>
                So he walks the world alone<br>
                Wondering if it gets better<br>
                Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever<br>
                So he gets lost tryna find another way back home<br>
                As he walks the world alone<br>
                15 years and he's drowning his sorrows<br>
                Smoking weed, drinking cheap liquor out the bottle<br>
                With a bunch of fake friends 'cause he tried to fit in<br>
                But it wasn't working<br>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <h3>
                            The lyrics of Nico Collins' "Alone" relate to Holden Caulfield in several ways. The lines "I'll only go to school if you give me a reason / The kids are really mean and I already know / All the things they're teaching" reflect Holden's attitude towards school in "The Catcher in the Rye." He sees school as a place where phonies and bullies thrive, and he struggles to find meaning in the curriculum. In chapter two of the book, Holden says, "I'm not too crazy about the idea of leaving this school. It's not that I'm afraid of the subject or anything, but I hate to leave a place, I always hate to leave a place."
                        </h3>

                <button class="accordion">Bordem and Disconnection</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <h3>
                            Similarly, in the song, the main character misses the first hour of school just to get a cup of coffee and daydreams away to a sky so gray. He shows up late to class and stares out the window, feeling unfulfilled by the monotony of his daily routine. These experiences parallel Holden's own struggles with boredom and disconnection.
                        </h3>
                    </div>

                <button class="accordion">Alienation</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <h3>
                            The lines "He does all that he should / Why is he misunderstood? / This is a story 'bout a broken boy / With his headphones in just to block out the noise / Of everyone around him telling him the way to go" also reflect Holden's feelings of alienation and frustration with the people around him. He is constantly questioning why he doesn't fit in and why he is misunderstood by those around him. He seeks refuge in his own thoughts and feelings, much like the main character of the song.
                        </h3>
                    </div>

                <button class="accordion">Searching for Authenticity and a Genuine Connection</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <h3>
                            Finally, the lines "Wondering if it gets better / Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever / So he gets lost tryna find another way back home / As he walks the world alone" reflect Holden's search for meaning and connection in a world that feels empty and meaningless. He is constantly searching for a way to connect with others and make sense of his experiences. The song's portrayal of a young person struggling to find their place in the world resonates with the themes of "The Catcher in the Rye" and the character of Holden Caulfield.
