                Eight years old and he's kicking and screaming <br>
                "I'll only go to school if you give me a reason <br>
                The kids are really mean and I already know <br>
                All the things they're teaching" <br> <br>
                Hopped in the car, mama let him play hooky <br>
                Missed the first hour just to get a cup of coffee <br>
                She's the only one who saw who he was <br>
                No one else could read him <br> <br>
                Showing up late but he makes it to class <br>
                Just to stare out the window and the clock in the back <br>
                He daydreamed away to a sky so gray <br>
                Everything's simple, it's driving him mental <br> <br>
                Wishing everyday that something would change <br>
                Instead his dad makes him play ball by the bay <br>
                And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes, saying <br>
                "Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?" <br> <br>
                He does all that he should <br>
                Why is he misunderstood? <br> <br>
                This is a story 'bout a broken boy<br>
                With his headphones in just to block out the noise<br>
                Of everyone around him telling him the way to go<br>
                So he walks the world alone<br> <br>
                Wondering if it gets better<br>
                Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever<br>
                So he gets lost tryna find another way back home<br>
                As he walks the world alone<br> <br>
                15 years and he's drowning his sorrows<br>
                Smoking weed, drinking cheap liquor out the bottle<br>
                With a bunch of fake friends 'cause he tried to fit in<br>
                But it wasn't working<br>

            <div class="songs">
                 <button class="accordion">Holden's Attitude Towards School</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            The lyrics of Nico Collins' "Alone" relate to Holden Caulfield in several ways: <br> <br>
                           
                            "I'll only go to school if you give me a reason <br>
                            The kids are really mean and I already know <br>
                            All the things they're teaching" (Collins). <br> <br>

                            This reflects Holden's attitude towards school in "The Catcher in the Rye".
                            He sees school as a place where phonies and bullies thrive, and he struggles 
                            to find meaning in the curriculum. In Chapter 1, Holden describes the boarding school he attends, Pencey Prep, as a pretentious place that cultivates a false image of sophistication and propriety. Holden scoffs at the school’s advertisements in magazines, which depict “hot-shots” playing polo, claiming that the school does not even have horses, let alone a polo team. For Holden, the ad embodies the fundamental hypocrisy of Pencey Prep. The expensive school claims be a place that shapes boys into young men of character, but Holden cynically dismisses it as a place full of crooks and phonies.   
                            Holden says, "Pencey Prep is this school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You've probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hot-shot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place" (Salinger 1).

                <button class="accordion">Bordem and Disconnection</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            Similarly, the song reflects Holden's struggles with boredom and disconnection: <br><br>

                            "Showing up late but he makes it to class <br>
                            Just to stare out the window and the clock in the back <br>
                            He daydreamed away to a sky so gray <br>
                            Everything's simple, it's driving him mental <br>
                            Wishing every day that something would change <br>
                            Instead his dad makes him play ball by the bay <br>
                            And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes, saying <br>
                            'Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?" <br> <br>

                            He finds himself lost in his own thoughts and feelings, much like 
                            the main character of the song. 
                            This point is allegorical because the characters' internal 
                            struggles are used to represent the human need for introspection
                            and reflection. The characters' tendency to turn inward reflects
                            the idea that humans must take the time to understand and connect
                            with their own emotions in order to better understand the world
                            around them. <br><br>

                            Holden's relationship with his 
                            father is also tumultuous. The song is reminiscent of the strained 
                            relationship between Holden and his father. <br> <br>
                           
                            "And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes, saying <br>
                            'Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?'" <br> <br>

                            From the very start of "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden says, 
                            "I don't think my parents know much about me. [...] They're quite
                            touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're
                            nice and all-I'm not saying that-but they're also touchy as hell"
                            (Salinger 19). <br> <br>
                            The strained relationships between the main characters and their
                            fathers represent the challenges of intergenerational communication
                            and understanding. This point is allegorical because the characters'
                            relationship with their fathers is used to represent the broader 
                            challenges that can arise between different generations. The characters'
                            fathers are used to represent the older generation, while the main characters
                            are used to represent the younger generation. The struggles between 
                            the characters and their fathers reflect the broader challenges that 
                            can arise between these two generations as they try to navigate their 
                            different experiences and perspectives.

                <button class="accordion">Alienation</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            The song also reflect Holden's 
                            feelings of alienation and frustration with the people around him:

                            "He does all that he should
                            Why is he misunderstood?
                            This is a story 'bout a broken boy
                            With his headphones in just to block out the noise
                            Of everyone around him telling him the way to go" 
                            
                            He is constantly questioning why he doesn't fit in and why he 
                            is misunderstood by those around him. He seeks refuge in his own
                            thoughts and feelings, much like the main character of the song. <br><br>

                            Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye," 
                            is portrayed as an individual who is alienated from society due to his anti-establishment 
                            ideals. Salinger uses a variety of quotes throughout the novel to illustrate Holden's distaste
                            for the "phoniness" of the adult world and his inability to relate to the people around him. 
                            In one such quote, Holden explains his distaste for the adults around him, stating, 
                            "I can't explain what I mean. And even if I could, I'm not sure I'd feel like it" (Salinger 9).
                            This quote is significant because it highlights Holden's feelings of isolation and his inability
                            to communicate with those around him. Another quote that illustrates Holden's alienation is when 
                            he says, "People always think something's all true" (Salinger 16). This quote illustrates Holden's 
                            skepticism of societal norms and his tendency to question the motives and intentions of those around him. 
                            Holden's alienation is also evident in his interactions with his peers, as he struggles to connect with 
                            them on a personal level. As he reflects on his time at Pencey Prep, he states, 
                            "I felt so damn lonesome" (Salinger 51). This quote illustrates Holden's feelings of loneliness 
                            and his inability to connect with those around him. In combination, these quotes demonstrate the theme of 
                            Holden's alienation from society, and the struggle he faces to reconcile his own ideals and beliefs with 
                            the expectations of the adult world. <br><br>

                            The experience of Holden Caulfield's alienation and struggle to reconcile his own ideals with the expectations of the adult world can be considered an allegory for the broader teenage experience. The teenage years are often marked by a sense of alienation and disconnection from the adult world, as young people struggle to define their own identity and beliefs while navigating the expectations and norms of the society around them. Holden's alienation from society, his skepticism of societal norms, and his struggles to connect with his peers all reflect the broader experience of young people as they try to find their place in the world. Holden's desire for authenticity and his rejection of the "phoniness" of the adult world are also allegorical for the broader human desire for meaning and authenticity, as people strive to connect with others and find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their lives. Overall, the experience of Holden Caulfield in "The Catcher in the Rye" is an allegory for the teenage experience, highlighting the universal struggle to find one's place in the world and to reconcile one's own beliefs and ideals with the expectations of the society around them.

                        <p>
                            Finally, the song reflects Holden's search for meaning and connection 
                            in a world that feels empty and meaningless. <br> <br>

                            "Wondering if it gets better <br>
                            Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever <br>

                            He is constantly searching for a way to connect with others and make sense of his experiences. 
                            The song's portrayal of a young person struggling to find their place in the world resonates 
                            with the themes of "The Catcher in the Rye" and the character of Holden Caulfield. <br><br>

                            Throughout J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden Caulfield's desperate search for authenticity and a genuine connection is a central theme of the novel. Salinger uses a variety of quotes throughout the book to illustrate Holden's deep sense of alienation from society and his longing for something more. In one such quote, Holden reflects on his relationships with others, stating, "What I really felt like, though, was committing suicide. I felt like jumping out the window. I probably would've done it, too, if I'd been sure somebody'd cover me up as soon as I landed" (Salinger 104). This quote highlights Holden's feelings of isolation and his desperate search for someone who understands him. Another quote that illustrates Holden's longing for a genuine connection is when he says, "I have a feeling that you're riding for some kind of a terrible, terrible fall. But I don't honestly know what kind" (Salinger 253). This quote reflects Holden's desperation to find someone who is genuine and honest, even if it means facing the harsh realities of the world. Holden's search for authenticity is also evident in his interactions with Phoebe, as he tells her, "All I want to be is the catcher in the rye. I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them" (Salinger 224). This quote illustrates Holden's desire to protect the innocence of children and his longing for a more genuine, innocent world. Overall, these quotes demonstrate the theme of Holden's desperate search for authenticity and a genuine connection in a world that he perceives as being "phony" and artificial. <br><br>

                            The struggles of the main character in the song and the book represent the universal 
                            human experience of feeling lost, disconnected, and misunderstood. This point is allegorical
                            because the experiences of the characters in the song and the book are used to represent 
                            the broader human condition of searching for meaning and connection in a world that can feel
                            empty and meaningless. In other words, the song and the book use the struggles of their respective
                            characters to convey a broader moral principle about the human experience.

                            The lyrics of Alec Benjamin's "Water Fountain" relate to the character 
                            of Holden Caulfield in several ways. In his song Alec sings, <br><br>
                            
                            "She told me that she loved me by the water fountain <br>
                            She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him <br>
                            And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent <br>
                            But now she's got a cup with something else in it," (Benjamin). <br><br>
                            
                            It reflects on Holden's longing for connection and his idealized view of relationships.
                            In "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden seeks out meaningful connections with others,
                            but he struggles to find them. He often romanticizes relationships and is 
                            disappointed when they don't meet his idealized expectations. <br><br>
                            
                            For example, in chapter 11 of the book, Holden says, 
                            "The trouble with girls is, if they like a boy, no matter
                            how big a bastard he is, they'll say he has an inferiority 
                            complex, and if they don't like him, no matter how nice a
                            guy he is, or how big an inferiority complex he has, they'll say he's conceited" (Salinger 72). <br><br>

                            Another instance in Chapter 9 of "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden watches people from his hotel room window.
                            He witnesses several situations that pique his interest, one being a man and a woman taking turns spitting
                            water at each other. Holden is intrigued by this strange behavior and comments, "I watched them for about
                            a half an hour" (62). Holden is so fascinated by this oddity that he watches them for a significant amount
                            of time. Later in the chapter, Holden witnesses another situation that catches his attention. He 
                            sees a man and a woman play-fighting in the hotel hallway, and the woman ends up with her dress torn. 
                            Holden is shocked by this behavior and comments, "They were going around and around, quite some
                            little scuffle...Finally he got her dress up, and her whole back was all out" (68). He is disturbed
                            by the scene and feels that the woman is being mistreated. These two incidents reveal Holden's 
                            preoccupation with the behavior of others and his tendency to observe and analyze those around him. 
                            He is fascinated by the strange behavior of the spitting couple but repelled by the violent 
                            behavior of the man and woman in the hallway, which highlights is romanization of relationships.<br><br>

                            The struggles of the main character in the song and the book represent the universal
                            human experience of seeking connection and meaning in a complex world. This point is
                            allegorical because the experiences of the characters in the song and the book are used
                            to represent the broader human condition of searching for purpose and connection. In 
                            other words, the song and the book use the struggles of their respective characters 
                            to convey a broader moral principle about the human experience.

                        <p>
                            Similarly, when Alec sings, <br><br>
                            "And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin <br>
                            She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him <br>
                            Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain" (Benjamin). <br><br>
                            
                            It reflects on Holden's discomfort with the sexualization of relationships. 
                            He struggles to reconcile his desire for intimacy with his own moral code,
                            which values innocence and purity. In chapter 13 of the book, Holden says, 
                            "I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around 
                            once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing 
                            their noses or even just giggling or something" (Salinger 50). <br><br>

                            Another example of this is in Chapter 12 of "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. 
                            Salinger, Holden is conflicted when a prostitute named Sunny arrives at his hotel room. 
                            He is attracted to her, yet he is also repelled by her profession and calls her "spooky" (Salinger 97).
                            Holden wants to have
                            a sexual experience, but he also wants to maintain his innocence and not "lose his virginity" 
                            He is torn between his desire for human connection and his desire to remain pure. He tells
                            Sunny that he just wants to talk, but she is insistent on performing her job. Holden is 
                            uncomfortable with her advances and starts to feel even more uneasy when he realizes that 
                            she is just a child. He tries to back out of the situation, but he feels guilty and eventually 
                            gives in to Sunny's demands. This conflict between Holden's desire for human connection 
                            and his need to maintain innocence reveals his struggle with the transition from childhood 
                            to adulthood. He is not sure how to navigate the world of adult relationships, and he 
                            is desperate to hold on to the innocence of his childhood. The conflict also shows his 
                            vulnerability and his deep desire for someone to understand him.. <br><br>

                            The characters in the song and the book struggle with the loss of innocence
                            and the complexities of growing up. This point is allegorical because the
                            characters' experiences are used to represent the broader challenges of navigating
                            the transition from childhood to adulthood (being a teenager). The characters' struggles with growing
                            up reflect the idea that humans must grapple with the loss of innocence and the 
                            challenges of taking on adult responsibilities.

                        <p>
                            Furthermore, when Alec sings, <br><br>
                            "She couldn't be at home in the nighttime because <br>
                            It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young <br>
                            I was too young <br>
                            I should've built a home with a fountain for us <br>
                            The moment that she told me that she was in love too young <br>
                            I was too young" (Benjamin). <br><br>
                            
                            It reflects on Holden's struggle to navigate the complexities of growing up. 
                            He is constantly wrestling with the idea of innocence and the loss of innocence,
                            and he often feels like he is caught between two worlds. The song's portrayal 
                            of a young person struggling to find their place in the world resonates with
                            the themes of "The Catcher in the Rye" and the character of Holden Caulfield. <br><br>

                            An example that this is emulated in is when Holden meets two nuns at a diner 
                            and decides to have a conversation with them. During their interaction, Holden 
                            makes several assumptions about the nuns based on their religious affiliation. 
                            One assumption he makes is that they are impoverished, and he offers to buy them 
                            dinner. Holden assumes this because he remembers that nuns "take a vow of poverty" 
                            and "all they do is teach" (Salinger, 110). However, the nuns politely decline, 
                            and one of them tells Holden that they have "already eaten" (Salinger, 110). 
                            Another assumption Holden makes is that the nuns are "kind of old," as he 
                            describes them as "around fifty or so" (Salinger, 112). However, one of the nuns 
                            tells Holden that she is "only twenty-six," which surprises him (Salinger, 112). 
                            These assumptions Holden makes about the nuns highlight his tendency to categorize 
                            people based on their external appearance and to make assumptions without knowing 
                            the full story. Which is one of the biggest examples of being forced out of childish assumptions and opneing his eyes to the real world.
                            It also demonstrates how Holden's preoccupation with labeling 
                            people and putting them in boxes is misguided and often inaccurate, much like a child's. <br><br>

                            The characters in the song and the book struggle with reconciling their idealized
                            views of relationships with the complexities of real-world connections. This point
                            is allegorical because the characters' experiences are used to represent the broader
                            challenge of reconciling one's own idealized views of relationships with the complex
                            realities of human connections. The characters' struggles reflect the idea that humans
                            must navigate the complexities of relationships in order to find meaningful connections.

                            around him. In "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden often suppresses his emotions and tries to put on a 
                            brave face, hiding his true feelings from the people around him. For example, in chapter 7 of the 
                            book, Holden says, "I put on this hat that I'd bought in New York that morning. It was this red hunting
                            hat, with one of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway, 
                            just after I noticed I'd lost all the goddam foils. It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the 
                            old peak way around to the back—very corny, I'll admit, but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way" (Salinger 18). <br><br>

                            The use of the mask as a symbol represents the idea of a façade, of hiding one's true emotions and thoughts 
                            from the world. The mask is used as a metaphor for the persona or façade that people often adopt to conceal 
                            their true selves from others. It is a representation of the theme of alienation and disconnection between 
                            individuals and society.

                            "Always bein' judged by a bunch of strange faces

                            reflect Holden's struggles with feeling like an outsider in the world around him. He often 
                            feels like he is judged by the people around him, and he struggles to connect with others. 
                            In chapter 2 of the book, Holden says, "You never saw so many phonies in all your life, 
                            everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear
                            and know how sharp they were" (Salinger 16). <br><br>

                            The struggle to navigate the complexities of growing up represents the broader human 
                            condition of struggling to find one's place in the world. The song and the book 
                            explore the human experience of trying to find one's place in the world and the 
                            struggle to navigate the complexities of growing up

                            In J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden Caulfield constantly grapples with the pressure to succeed and fit in, while also trying to find himself on his journey of self-discovery. Salinger uses a variety of quotes throughout the novel to illustrate Holden's struggle to reconcile his own ideals and beliefs with the expectations of the adult world. In one such quote, Holden reflects on his time at Pencey Prep, stating, "It was one of the worst schools I ever went to. It was full of phonies. And mean guys. You never saw so many mean guys in your life" (Salinger 5). This quote illustrates Holden's distaste for the conformity and insincerity that he sees around him. Another quote that illustrates Holden's struggle is when he says, "I was trying to feel some kind of a good-bye. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-bye or a bad good-bye, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it" (Salinger 4). This quote highlights Holden's desire for meaning and authenticity in his life and his longing for a sense of closure and understanding. Holden's struggle to find himself is also evident in his interactions with his peers, as he struggles to connect with them on a personal level. As he reflects on his time at Pencey Prep, he states, "I felt so damn lonesome. I almost wished I was dead" (Salinger 51). This quote illustrates Holden's feelings of isolation and his desperate search for someone who understands him. Overall, these quotes demonstrate the theme of Holden's constant grappling with the pressure to succeed and fit in, while also trying to find himself on his journey of self-discovery. Holden's struggle to reconcile his own ideals and beliefs with the expectations of the adult world highlights the broader human experience of trying to find one's place in the world, and the challenge of balancing personal authenticity with societal expectations. <br><br>

                            The sense of isolation and feeling like an outsider is an allegory for the theme 
                            of disconnection between individuals and society. The song and the book use the 
                            experience of feeling like an outsider to represent the broader theme of disconnection
                            between individuals and society. The characters in both the song and the book are 
                            struggling to connect with others and find meaning in their lives.
