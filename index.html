                <br>
                Eight years old and he's kicking and screaming <br>
                "I'll only go to school if you give me a reason <br>
                The kids are really mean and I already know <br>
                All the things they're teaching" <br> <br>
                Hopped in the car, mama let him play hooky <br>
                Missed the first hour just to get a cup of coffee <br>
                She's the only one who saw who he was <br>
                No one else could read him <br> <br>
                Showing up late but he makes it to class <br>
                Just to stare out the window and the clock in the back <br>
                He daydreamed away to a sky so gray <br>
                Everything's simple, it's driving him mental <br> <br>
                Wishing everyday that something would change <br>
                Instead his dad makes him play ball by the bay <br>
                And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes, saying <br>
                "Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?" <br> <br>
                He does all that he should <br>
                Why is he misunderstood? <br> <br>
                This is a story 'bout a broken boy<br>
                With his headphones in just to block out the noise<br>
                Of everyone around him telling him the way to go<br>
                So he walks the world alone<br> <br>
                Wondering if it gets better<br>
                Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever<br>
                So he gets lost tryna find another way back home<br>
                As he walks the world alone<br> <br>
                15 years and he's drowning his sorrows<br>
                Smoking weed, drinking cheap liquor out the bottle<br>
                With a bunch of fake friends 'cause he tried to fit in<br>
                But it wasn't working<br>

            <div class="songs">
                 <button class="accordion">Holden's Attitude Towards School</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            The lyrics of Nico Collins' "Alone" relate to Holden Caulfield in several ways: <br> <br>
                           
                            "I'll only go to school if you give me a reason <br>
                            The kids are really mean and I already know <br>
                            All the things they're teaching" (Collins). <br> <br>

                            This reflects Holden's attitude towards school in "The Catcher in the Rye".
                            He sees school as a place where phonies and bullies thrive, and he struggles 
                            to find meaning in the curriculum. In chapter two of the book, Holden says, 
                            "I'm not too crazy about the idea of leaving this school. It's not that I'm
                            afraid of the subject or anything, but I hate to leave a place, I always 
                            hate to leave a place" (Salinger 16).

                <button class="accordion">Bordem and Disconnection</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            Similarly, the song reflects Holden's struggles with boredom and disconnection: <br><br>

                            "Showing up late but he makes it to class <br>
                            Just to stare out the window and the clock in the back <br>
                            He daydreamed away to a sky so gray <br>
                            Everything's simple, it's driving him mental <br>
                            Wishing every day that something would change <br>
                            Instead his dad makes him play ball by the bay <br>
                            And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes, saying <br>
                            'Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?" <br> <br>

                            He finds himself lost in his own thoughts and feelings, much like 
                            the main character of the song. 
                            This point is allegorical because the characters' internal 
                            struggles are used to represent the human need for introspection
                            and reflection. The characters' tendency to turn inward reflects
                            the idea that humans must take the time to understand and connect
                            with their own emotions in order to better understand the world
                            around them. <br><br>

                            Holden's relationship with his 
                            father is also tumultuous. The song is reminiscent of the strained 
                            relationship between Holden and his father. <br> <br>
                           
                            "And every time he cries, father rolls his eyes, saying <br>
                            'Son it's all your fault, how come you never try?'" <br> <br>

                            From the very start of "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden says, 
                            "I don't think my parents know much about me. [...] They're quite
                            touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're
                            nice and all-I'm not saying that-but they're also touchy as hell"
                            (Salinger 19). <br> <br>
                            The strained relationships between the main characters and their
                            fathers represent the challenges of intergenerational communication
                            and understanding. This point is allegorical because the characters'
                            relationship with their fathers is used to represent the broader 
                            challenges that can arise between different generations. The characters'
                            fathers are used to represent the older generation, while the main characters
                            are used to represent the younger generation. The struggles between 
                            the characters and their fathers reflect the broader challenges that 
                            can arise between these two generations as they try to navigate their 
                            different experiences and perspectives.

                <button class="accordion">Alienation</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            The song also reflect Holden's 
                            feelings of alienation and frustration with the people around him:

                            "He does all that he should
                            Why is he misunderstood?
                            This is a story 'bout a broken boy
                            With his headphones in just to block out the noise
                            Of everyone around him telling him the way to go" 
                            
                            He is constantly questioning why he doesn't fit in and why he 
                            is misunderstood by those around him. He seeks refuge in his own
                            thoughts and feelings, much like the main character of the song.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <button class="accordion">Searching for Authenticity and a Genuine Connection</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            Finally, the song reflects Holden's search for meaning and connection 
                            in a world that feels empty and meaningless. <br> <br>

                            "Wondering if it gets better <br>
                            Or if he's always gonna feel empty forever <br>
                            So he gets lost tryna find another way back home <br>
                            As he walks the world alone"  <br> <br>
                            
                            He is constantly searching for a way to connect with others and make sense of his experiences. 
                            The song's portrayal of a young person struggling to find their place in the world resonates 
                            with the themes of "The Catcher in the Rye" and the character of Holden Caulfield. <br><br>

                            The struggles of the main character in the song and the book represent the universal 
                            human experience of feeling lost, disconnected, and misunderstood. This point is allegorical
                            because the experiences of the characters in the song and the book are used to represent 
                            the broader human condition of searching for meaning and connection in a world that can feel
                            empty and meaningless. In other words, the song and the book use the struggles of their respective
                            characters to convey a broader moral principle about the human experience.

                She told me that she loved me by the water fountain <br>
                She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him <br>
                And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent <br>
                But now she's got a cup with something else in it <br>
                It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter-past-ten <br>
                And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin <br>
                She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him <br>
                Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain <br> <br>
                Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in <br>
                Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear <br>
                And she knows that she shouldn't listen <br>
                And that she should be with me by the water fountain <br> <br>
                She couldn't be at home in the night time because <br>
                It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young <br>
                I was too young <br>
                I should've built a home with a fountain for us <br>
                The moment that she told me that she was in love too young <br>
                I was too young <br> <br>
                Too young, too young <br>

                            The lyrics of Alec Benjamin's "Water Fountain" relate to the character 
                            of Holden Caulfield in several ways. In his song Alec sings, <br><br>
                            
                            "She told me that she loved me by the water fountain <br>
                            She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him <br>
                            And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent <br>
                            But now she's got a cup with something else in it," (Benjamin). <br><br>
                            
                            It reflects on Holden's longing for connection and his idealized view of relationships.
                            In "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden seeks out meaningful connections with others,
                            but he struggles to find them. He often romanticizes relationships and is 
                            disappointed when they don't meet his idealized expectations. 
                            
                            For example, in chapter 11 of the book, Holden says, 
                            "The trouble with girls is, if they like a boy, no matter
                            how big a bastard he is, they'll say he has an inferiority 
                            complex, and if they don't like him, no matter how nice a
                            guy he is, or how big an inferiority complex he has, they'll say he's conceited" (Salinger, #). <br><br>

                            The struggles of the main character in the song and the book represent the universal
                            human experience of seeking connection and meaning in a complex world. This point is
                            allegorical because the experiences of the characters in the song and the book are used
                            to represent the broader human condition of searching for purpose and connection. In 
                            other words, the song and the book use the struggles of their respective characters 
                            to convey a broader moral principle about the human experience.

                            Similarly, when Alec sings, <br><br>
                            "And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin <br>
                            She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him <br>
                            Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain" (Benjamin). <br><br>
                            
                            It reflects on Holden's discomfort with the sexualization of relationships. 
                            He struggles to reconcile his desire for intimacy with his own moral code,
                            which values innocence and purity. In chapter 13 of the book, Holden says, 
                            "I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around 
                            once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing 
                            their noses or even just giggling or something" (Salinger, #) <br><br>

                            The characters in the song and the book struggle with the loss of innocence
                            and the complexities of growing up. This point is allegorical because the
                            characters' experiences are used to represent the broader challenges of navigating
                            the transition from childhood to adulthood. The characters' struggles with growing
                            up reflect the idea that humans must grapple with the loss of innocence and the 
                            challenges of taking on adult responsibilities.

                            Furthermore, when Alec sings, <br><br>
                            "She couldn't be at home in the nighttime because <br>
                            It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young <br>
                            I was too young <br>
                            I should've built a home with a fountain for us <br>
                            The moment that she told me that she was in love too young <br>
                            I was too young" (Benjamin). <br><br>
                            
                            It reflects on Holden's struggle to navigate the complexities of growing up. 
                            He is constantly wrestling with the idea of innocence and the loss of innocence,
                            and he often feels like he is caught between two worlds. The song's portrayal 
                            of a young person struggling to find their place in the world resonates with
                            the themes of "The Catcher in the Rye" and the character of Holden Caulfield. <br><br>

                            The characters in the song and the book struggle with reconciling their idealized
                            views of relationships with the complexities of real-world connections. This point
                            is allegorical because the characters' experiences are used to represent the broader
                            challenge of reconciling one's own idealized views of relationships with the complex
                            realities of human connections. The characters' struggles reflect the idea that humans
                            must navigate the complexities of relationships in order to find meaningful connections.

                And when they ask me how I'm doing, I say, "I'm just fine" <br>

                I can never get off of my mattress <br>

                        <p>
                            The lyrics of Dream's "Mask" reflect the struggles of the character of Holden Caulfield in several ways: <br><br>
                            "I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time <br>
                            Stare at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind <br>
                            And when they ask me how I'm doing, I say, 'I'm just fine' <br>
                            And when they ask me how I'm doing, I say, 'I'm just fine'" <br> <br>
                            
                            The song reflects Holden's tendency to suppress his emotions and put on a façade of indifference to the world
                            around him. In "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden often suppresses his emotions and tries to put on a 
                            brave face, hiding his true feelings from the people around him. For example, in chapter 7 of the 
                            book, Holden says, "I put on this hat that I'd bought in New York that morning. It was this red hunting
                            hat, with one of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway, 
                            just after I noticed I'd lost all the goddam foils. It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the 
                            old peak way around to the back—very corny, I'll admit, but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way." <br><br>

                            The use of the mask as a symbol represents the idea of a façade, of hiding one's true emotions and thoughts 
                            from the world. The mask is used as a metaphor for the persona or façade that people often adopt to conceal 
                            their true selves from others. It is a representation of the theme of alienation and disconnection between 
                            individuals and society.

                            Similarly, the lines 
                            "Always bein' judged by a bunch of strange faces
                            Scared to go outside, haven't seen the light in ages" 
                            
                            reflect Holden's struggles with feeling like an outsider in the world around him. He often 
                            feels like he is judged by the people around him, and he struggles to connect with others. 
                            In chapter 2 of the book, Holden says, "You never saw so many phonies in all your life, 
                            everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear
                            and know how sharp they were" (Salinger 16). <br><br>

                            The struggle to navigate the complexities of growing up represents the broader human 
                            condition of struggling to find one's place in the world. The song and the book 
                            explore the human experience of trying to find one's place in the world and the 
                            struggle to navigate the complexities of growing up

                            reflect Holden's struggle to navigate the expectations of the adult world. 
                            He is constantly grappling with the pressure to succeed and to fit in, and 
                            he often feels like he is falling short. The song's portrayal of a young person 
                            struggling to navigate the complexities of growing up resonates with the themes 
                            of "The Catcher in the Rye" and the character of Holden Caulfield. <br><br>

                            The sense of isolation and feeling like an outsider is an allegory for the theme 
                            of disconnection between individuals and society. The song and the book use the 
                            experience of feeling like an outsider to represent the broader theme of disconnection
                            between individuals and society. The characters in both the song and the book are 
                            struggling to connect with others and find meaning in their lives.

                In conclusion, the comparison of several song lyrics to J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher
                in the Rye" highlights the timeless themes of the book and the enduring relevance of 
                its portrayal of a young person struggling to navigate the complexities of growing up. 
                The lyrics of Nico Collins' "Alone" and Alec Benjamin's "Water Fountain" demonstrate 
                the struggles of the characters to reconcile their idealized views of relationships 
                with the complexities of real-world connections, while Dream's "Mask" captures the essence 
                of Holden Caulfield's character and his struggle to suppress his emotions, feeling like an 
                outsider in the world, and navigate the expectations of the adult world. These lyrics are 
                allegorical and represent the broader human condition of seeking connection and meaning in 
                a complex world, the universal challenge of reconciling one's own idealized views of 
                relationships with the complex realities of human connections, and the struggle to find 
                one's place in the world and to connect with others. By using allegory, the authors and 
                songwriters are able to explore complex ideas and themes in a way that is accessible and 
                relatable to a broad audience, conveying a deeper meaning and message to their readers and 
                listeners. The comparison of the song lyrics to "The Catcher in the Rye" demonstrates the 
                enduring relevance of the novel and its ability to speak to the universal human experience of 
                growing up and finding one's place in the world.
